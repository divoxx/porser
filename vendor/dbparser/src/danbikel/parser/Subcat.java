/**
 * Specification for a collection of required arguments to be
 * generated by a parser, also known as a subcategorization frame.  In
 * the parsing models supported by this package, a subcategorization
 * frame, or simply <i>subcat</i>, has a slightly modified semantics,
 * more general in one sense, more specific in another: it is the
 * collection of requirements on a particular side of a head child of
 * some parent nonterminal that have yet to be met, where a
 * requirement is typically an argument nonterminal to be generated,
 * but may also include other elements generated by the parser, such
 * as traces (gaps).  Thus, the subcats specified by this interface
 * are dynamic, in that they start off with a full set of requirements
 * that gets diminished as parsing proceeds.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may choose the manner in which
 * these requirements are met via their implementations of the
 * <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods.  For example, a
 * very simple implementation might simply increment an internal
 * counter for every call to <code>add</code>, decrementing this
 * counter for every call to <code>remove</code>, causing the
 * semantics for subcat frames to be simply a requirement on the
 * <i>number</i> of modifying nonterminals generated, regardless of
 * their labels.  A more sophisticated implementation might insist on
 * generating all arguments in the order in which they were added to
 * this subcat frame.  In general, no implementation should require more
 * calls to <code>remove</code> than the number of requirements added
 * via invocations of <code>add</code> and <code>addAll</code>.
 * <p>
 * At minimum, all implementing classes should have a no-argument
 * default constructor and a one-argument constructor that accepts a
 * <code>SexpList</code> containing only <code>Symbol</code> objects,
 * to be passed to the {@link #addAll(SexpList)} method.
 *
 * @see Subcats
